# Ultrablastkin

## Description

Ultrablastkin is a 2D-platformer that I am working on using the Godot engine.
It is being made using open-source art assets.

## Development

I plan to work on documenting the different programming decisions that I made
when developing this game. I am going to use MKDocs for this, since it was
made for that purpose.

During development I used various design patterns to make refactoring easier.
A great resource for understanding the different design patterns is to read the
[Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html)
by Robert Nystrom. It is available for free online.

The engine that I am developing this game with is Godot. It is free and open-
source. There is also a lot of documentation for the engine which anyone can
contribute to and edit. View the main website at
[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and the documentation at
[Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/).
