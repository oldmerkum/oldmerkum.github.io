# Miscellaneous

Place for bragging about my studies and other items that aren't
big enough to be called a project.

## Japanese

Learning a new language is tough, but it's fun to play a little game on your
phone about Japanese.

I use [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) in my spare time instead of
infinitely scrolling instagram.

One more callout is for
[Japanese grammar guide](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar)
which is cool supplement for when I want to just read about the grammar without
worrying about being test by the duolingo phone app.

## Haskell

I was briefly introduced to functional programming language in college, but
didn't get enough time in class to explore it. I looked up some options, and
settled on [learning me some haskell](learnyouahaskell.com/).

That above online book was confusing though, and it is now my secondary resource
to [real world haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/) which offers some
exercises to complete for cementing and practicing the concepts. I have a public
github repo for storing my dummy haskell scripts and small assignments. Take a
look at my
[haskell practice repo](https://github.com/oldmerkum/haskell_practice).

## Cryptopals crypto challenges

The whole purpose of learning haskell was to work through the cryptopals
challenges, since it was recommended somewhere online to take it as an
opportunity to get familiar with a new programming language.

These challenges are for getting people some concrete practice with crypto.
