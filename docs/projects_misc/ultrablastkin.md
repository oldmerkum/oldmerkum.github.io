# UltraBlastKin

## Description

UltraBlastkin is a 2D-platformer. I used open source art online for the assets.
Once I clean up the repo, I'll make it public.

## Development

During development I used various design patterns to make refactoring easier.
A great resource for understanding the different design patterns is to read the
[Game Programming Patterns](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html)
by Robert Nystrom. It is available for free online.

The engine that I am developing this game with is Godot. It is free and open-
source. There is also a lot of documentation for the engine which anyone can
contribute to and edit. View the main website at
[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and the documentation at
[Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/).

## Art assets

The assets used are from various online artists.

[Rvros](https://rvros.itch.io/) created adventurer and slime sprite assets that
are great.

Couldn't find this person again, but their tag was foxley and they made cool
backgrounds and tile sets that I used.
