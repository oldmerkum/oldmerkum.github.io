## Overview

This is my personal website where I will put some projects that I work on.

## About me

I like working on little projects and learning new things.

I try to divide my time between learning about information security, game
development, video games, learning Japanese, family, and exercise.

I always find myself running out of time in the day to do everything I want.
It feels good at the end of the day to have stayed busy.
