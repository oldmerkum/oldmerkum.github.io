# MkDocs

This is a static website built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
It's usually for software documentation, but it makes a quick and easy personal
website as well.

Setup is pretty painless if you're familiar with python. You'll need to have
python, then install mkdocs using either pip or another package manager.
It might be a good idea to create a new python environment for this using venv
or conda.

## Windows 10 python

I used [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) to setup my python
environment in windows 10.

It allows you to install specific versions of python locally instead of on the
entire system.

## Github pages

This is hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) user site option.
Which allows everyone to host a free static website.
