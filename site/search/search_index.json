It is being made using open-source art assets. Development I plan to work on documenting the different programming decisions that I made when developing this game. I am going to use MKDocs for this, since it was made for that purpose. During development I used various design patterns to make refactoring easier. A great resource for understanding the different design patterns is to read the Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom. It is available for free online. The engine that I am developing this game with is Godot. It is free and open- source. There is also a lot of documentation for the engine which anyone can contribute to and edit. View the main website at Godot Engine and the documentation at Godot Docs . Demo I am providing a downloadable demo to be able to play the most recent build of the game.
